0 Hey honey! After you finish with garden why don't you introduce yourself to the neighbors? I will warn you, they are Triangles.
 -1 Ok, don't worry I will manage! 1
 -2 Guess I have to. 1

1 Oh, hello neighbor! Are you new in town?
 -1  Yep, just moved in. 2
 -2  I hope that much is clear. 3

2 Always nice to see a new face around here. How are you?
 -1  Fine, been working on my garden in the back. 4
 -2 Could be better, getting a little shakey. 5

3 Eh? Something bothering you?
 -1  Yes, something is. 6
 -2  I am living next to triangles right now. I am living my worst nightmare. 7

4 Oh? You a nature lover?
 -1 Yes, I studied ecological and environmental biology in college. 8
 -2 How would you do that? Would you find a knot in a tree first? 9
 -3 Sort of, came with part of my family. 10

5 Is something the matter?
 -1 I get a little nervous around others. 11
 -2 It is a bit cold, I guess. 12
 -3 I saw a Triangle... nevermind. 13

6 Can I help you with the issue?
 -1 Yes, move away. 14
 -2 No you can't. 15
 -3 Never. 16

7 How is that your worst nightmare?
 -1  You shapes are murderers! 17
 -2  My family is gone because of Trianlges. 18
 -3  Triangles are nothing but warmongers! 19

8 Oh, what college did you go to?
 -1 I went to Merrill at UCSC. 20
 -2 The big one above Santa Cruz. 21 
 -3 One that I could take biology classes at. 22

9 What are you talking about?
 -1  You called me a nature lover. I am just trying to figure out how that would work. 23
 -2  How one would be a nature lover. I guess women would have an easier time. Just need to find a branch that is small enough. 24

10 What do you mean?
 -1 My mom always spent a lot of time out in the forests of the old country. Guess the effects passed down to me. 25
 -2 My dad was a farmer in the old country. Guess I share his love to grow things. 26

11 Have you considered a therapist? They might help.
 -1  No, The thought never crossed my mind. 27
 -2  No, I could not stand being around them anyway. 28

12 The sun is out, how is it cold?
 -1  It is colder than the old country! 29
 -2  I don't want to talk about it. 30

13 You saw a Triangle do what? Come on, you can tell me.
 -1  You would not want to hear it. 31
 -2  I saw him kill a circle. 32

14 Eh? How would that solve the problem?
 -1 I don't like Trianlges, ok? 33
 -2 It would put my mind at ease. 34

15 Why not? I can help!
 -1 No, you can't. 35
 -2 Stop it! 36

16 Hey, why not?
 -1 Triangles caused it. 37
 -2 Because I say so, that is why! 38

17 Whoa! Where is this coming form?
 -1  I watched as one of you killed another Circle, just for his shoes! 39
 -2  Your shapes took my family's land and threw them into camps! 40

18 Oh.. What happened?
 -1  I came here for college, a little bit before the War began. I lost contact from them a few days after. All I had to go on were the papers. 41
 -2  I lost contact before the War, I never heard since... 42

19 Hey! What in the Nine Hells made you say that?
 -1  Triangles started the War! They are the reason so many died! 43
 -2  The War was caused by the greed of Triangles! 44

20 Hey, a fellow Merriller! Small world is it not?
 -1  You went to Merrill, too? Wow, it is a small world. 45
 -2  Wow! What did you study? 46

21 UCSC? I went there myself. Was a bit smaller back in my day, but it is still a good school.
 -1 Back in my day? You are not old enough to be using words like that. 47
 -2 Smaller? It has always been big. When did you go there? 48

22 Why can't you tell me where you went?
 -1 It is a little personal to tell someone that I do not know where I went to school is all. 49
 -2  I don't like telling others my personal history, ok? 50

23 What...how... Oh, ew. That is not what I meant.
 -1  What did you mean then? 51
 -2  Wait, what? 52

24 Wait, what are you saying?
 -1  Women would be better nature lovers. They can get something to fit better than us guys can. 53
 -2  Wait, Am I getting this wrong? I feel like I am missing something. 54

25 Ah, mothers. Mine used to make me fresh chocolate chip cookies every weekend. Oh how I miss her.
 -1 Oh? What happened to your mother? 55
 -2  What happened? 55

26 Hee, fathers. My dad would always pull pranks on mom. Oh how it made me laugh... I miss them.
 -1  What happened? 55
 -2  What happened to your dad? 55

27 I have been using this one for several years now. He has helped me a lot.
 -1 Why do you need a therapist? 56
 -2 Why do you have a therapist anyway? 56

28 Come on. It might help you with your problem.
 -1  I can't... I just can't. 57
 -2  No one else can fix my problem. Only I can. 57

29 Circles were thrown out of Circlevania ten years ago. You could not have been there the whole time.
 -1  I was not. I came here to study for college. 58
 -2  I still spent a lot of my life there. 59

30 Why not? What is the matter?
 -1  I just...I can't take it anymore! 60
 -2  It is nothing.. I just...just... I just can't take it. 60

31 Come on, I will not hate it.
 -1 I saw a triangle kill another Circle for his shoes. 61
 -2 If you say so. I saw a triangle kill another Circle. 61

32 Oh god. Are you ok?
 -1 Yeah, I am fine. It has been a few years. 62
 -2 No, It still haunts me to this day. I can't trust anyone. 63

33 Why not? We have done nothing wrong.
 -1 You shapes started the War. I would call that something. 64
 -2  Nothing? The War was nothing!? 64

34 How would it?
 -1  Triangles can not be trusted! That is the end of it. 65
 -2  You can't be trusted, no one can. 65

35 Come on! This is silly.
 -1  Protecting myself is silly? 66
 -2  Tell that to the dead. 67

36 What is the matter with you!?
 -1  Triangles... They are evil! 65
 -2  You are all monsters! 65

37 What happened?
 -1  The War, that is what happened. 64
 -2  The loss of my family, isolation, the War. 64

38 Hey, no need to get mad.
 -1 The dead to not get mad. I get mad for them. 67
 -2 No need? The dead are not mad because they can't be mad anymore! 67

39 Oh, that is... disturbing. Are ok?
 -1 No I am not. How could I? 62
 -2 Funny for you to ask, killer. 68

40 Hey, I was not one of those monsters that ran those camps. I lost family to the camps as well.
 -1  Good, feel the justice the world enacted on you! 68
 -2  That is not enough. You must feel the pain your crimes have caused us! 68

41 Oh god. I saw the papers as well. The horror stories in them...
 -1   It was not pretty at all. 69
 -2   I can't remember the last time I had felt so depressed. 69

42 That must have been rough. I lost contact with my family around the same time.
 -1 It was. I could not find anyone to trust after that, still have not. 63
 -2  It shook my trust in the world. I could not find someone who could understand. 63

43 Come on! The War started from a massive misunderstanding between several nations. Not just the Triangles.
 -1  What utter lies. You would do anything to protect your sides. 68
 -2  Oh? Who suffered the most in the War and who were the Triangles largest enemy? 70

44 It was not us! We did not want anything!
 -1 Then why do you still have land that once belonged to the Circles! 70
 -2 Says the land stealer and child killer! 68

45  It really is. I have meant several other shapes who went there as well. We meet up sometimes on Friday nights.
 -1  Sounds like fun! May I come next time? 71
 -2  I would love to join that! Can I? 71

46 Computer Science. It was something I found interesting. Still have a group of friends that I meet with.
 -1  Can I come next time you guys meet? 71
 -2  Really? I never made friends there. Can I come? 71

47 Oh, but I am. I am an old man.
 -1  Nonsense, you look in the prime of your life! 72
 -2  Stop pulling yourself down! That is completely wrong! 72

48 About three decades ago. Feels even longer now...
 -1 Really? You don't look that old. 72
 -2  What. I do not believe that. You are not that old! 72

49 Fair enough. I used to be like that.
 -1 Yeah. I used to be worst until I met my wife. 73
 -2 Not as bad I was. My wife relly helped me with that. 73

50 Ok, alright. I can understand that.
 -1 Sorry about it. I just have trouble with people without my wife around. 73
 -2 Sorry, I am extremely shy. My wife has spent the past few years getting me out of my shell. 73

51 I meant nature lover as in, do you like nature. I have no idea where you got the other thing from.
 -1  Oh, I have no idea myself how that happened. My head went a little nuts there. 74
 -2  Oh god, I really went off on the wrong track there! I have no clue how that happened! 74

52 I meant something else completely by that statement.
 -1  Oh whoops. I often take words literally. Guess I did it again. 74
 -2  ...Oh. I made a huge mistake. Sorry about that. 74

53 ...What the hell are you talking about!?
 -1  Oh... It took it literally. Sorry I do that from time to time. 74
 -2  Ummm... I have no idea... I just go on tangents at times. Sorry about that. 74

54 You really are missing the whole point. I have no idea where you were going with that.
 -1  Yeah... I have a bad habit of doing that. 74
 -2 Ummm... I hate I admit it, but I did not know where I was going either. 74

55 I lost contact just before the War. I still don't know where they are.
 -1 I am sorry for your loss. I lost my family as well in the War. 75
 -2 ...I lost contact with my family just before the War as well. 75

56 I lost my family during the War. I don't know what happened to them.
 -1 I lost my family as well. I know how you feel. 75
 -2  I understand. I do not know what happened to my family either. 75

57 Why not? You can't hide away forever.
 -1  I am scaried. 76
 -2  I want to though. 76

58 You are avoiding the question at this point. Maybe professional help might be the solving for your problem.
 -1   Where? How? What makes you think that they can help me? 77
 -2   I don't know, who would I go to anyway? 77

59 It is not the cold, is it? You are shaking from something else.
 -1  I am trapped. I don't know where to go, can you help me? 77
 -2  I am not sure. How do I know if they can help? 77

60 What is the matter?
 -1  I am terrified of other shapes. Ever since the day I saw a Trianlge shoot another shape. 77
 -2  I saw one of you shoot another Circle. I can't take it any more. 77

61 Wow, that was surprising. I did not expect that.
 -1 I still see it clear as day in front of me. I can't take it anymore. 77
 -2  I want it to stop but I can never work up the courage to go and find help. 77

62 No you are not. Have you told your wife about this?
 -1  No, I don't want to trouble her. 78
 -2  I ..can't. 78

63 What about your wife? Do you trust her?
 -1  Of course, she is my wife. 78
 -2  Yes, she is there for me. She is my anchor, I would be lost without her. 78

64 Oh, are you going to blame it on me?
 -1  You? Of course not. Just on every Triangle ever! 79
 -2  Triangles caused my pain, of course I am! 79

65 We are not! Why would you even say that?
 -1 You caused the War! Lying, stealing, cruel Triangles! 80
 -2  What about the War? Was that no a break in trust? 80

66 What? How is that protecting yourself?
 -1 Make a shield around me, no one gets in. Keep everyone out. 81
 -2 No one can harm me then. Not even you. 81

67 What? This is about the War...
 -1 Of course it is! Nine million Circles died in the War. How can I not get mad? 82
 -2  My family died in the War! I am close to exploding! 82

68 Come on! How can you be so cruel?
 -1  Not as cruel an the triangles! 83
 -2  This is not cruel, this is justice. 83

69 Yeah, The photos as well...
 -1  I can't stop imagining my family... Just make it stop! 77
 -2  They were in those camps, it happened to them... Oh god... 77

70 That was done by the United Shapes! We had nothing to do with that!
 -1  Oh? What nation is on the security council? 84
 -2  Why are Triangles the head of the security council then? 84

71 Sure! They would love to meet another Banana Line!
 -1  Thanks, let me know when the next one is then. 91
 -2 Just make sure you alert me when it happens. 91

72 Kind of you to say that, but it is not true.
 -1 You can't put yourself down. You have to keep on trying! 85
 -2 That is not how any Triangle I know acts! Pick your head up! 85

73 Seems you owe a lot to your wife.
 -1 I do, it is just I can't find a job and if she ever loses hers... I don't know what to do. 86
 -2  Of course, I would be nothing without her. I want to thank her but all the money we have goes to food or debts. 86

74 It is ok, We all have moments like that. You might be tired. Why don't you go and take a little nap and we will finish our talk some other day.
 -1  Sounds nice to me. I am rather tired... See you again! 92
 -2  Guess I am not working at full capacity, I need to recharge... Talk with you later then! 92

75 You too? I barely know anyone not affected by the War. Strange, it was so long ago.
 -1   It was a big war, considering how large it was it is no wonder that people are still afffected. 87
 -2  The War took place across the Globe. It is no question that it would cause such harm. 87

76  I know you do, but we shapes are social things. Here is what I will do. Tomorrow I will give you the number of my therapist. He can help.
 -1 I hope so.. It has been a while since I had a good nights sleep. 88
 -2  I hope you are right. I want this behind me. 88

77 Calm down, and listen to me. I know a therapist. He helped me, so he can help you. I will give you his number tomorrow.
 -1  Thank you. You are a nice friend. I don't want it to bother me again. 88
 -2 Thank you, this is the first kind thing anyone other than my wife did for me. 88

78 You need to tell her, right now. I don't care about our conversation anymore. You need to do this, for her.
 -1 Ok, here I go.. this is for her, this is for her, this is for her... 93
 -2  I guess so.. If this will help... 93

79 Hey, it was the War, not us.
 -1  The War, Triangles they are the same thing! 89
 -2  There is no difference in my eyes. 89

80 We did not start the War!
 -1  Triangles fired the first shot! They did it to kill a Circle! 90
 -2  Of course you did! It was all to kill Circles! 90

81 Ok... I guess it is pointless to talk to you... Good day.
 -1  I am safe. No one will harm me. 94
 -2  Nothing comes close to me. Nothing can harm me. 94

82 Why must you bring up that? Triangles are not the cause!
 -1 Yes you are! It was all to take from us! 89
 -2  They are! And they will pay! 89

83 If you say that then you are no better than those monsters!
 -1 Of course we are better than Triangles! We have justice on our side! 90
 -2 Justice is with us! It is more than those Triangles can claim! 90

84 Hey, we were voted to that position in just the past decade!
 -1 But there you sit now! All part of the master plan! 90
 -2  But you are still there! Circles are not even in the United Shapes! 90

85 Hahahaha! You are a funny shape. I hope I can talk to you again.
 -1  I hope so too. 95
 -2  same here. 95

86 Then just try to get a job! It will show her that you still care!
 -1  I guess you are right. Thank you for the advice. 96
 -2  Thanks for the tip. I will try to keep up the job hunt. 96

87 I guess so. I hope next time we talk it will not be about such depressing stuff.
 -1  I don't think it will be. 97
 -2  I hope the same! 97

88 Of course, It is what I am here for.
 -1  Thank you. 98
 -2  Thanks, you are a good friend. 98

89 That is it. I am done. Get away from my house.
 -1 I was going to, you would have shoot me if I stood around for much longer! 99
 -2 I don't want to even walk by your house. It is a monster as well! 99

90 Oh my god. Don't do this to me in this season.
 -1 But of course, you have to get back to your chair and mug made from Circle parts, you monster. 100
 -2  This is not over. 100
