# CoreNight
Merrill College Core Night project

This is the first game I made with OpenGL and C++.

I made it for English class, of all things, and it's quite awful. About two or three days work total. I have a decent text system and a nice looking dialogue interface, but I was a bit short on time so the rest of the game is a complete mess.
